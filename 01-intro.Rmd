# Intro

AI has increasingly become a topic of conversation, as it is a new technology with infinite possibilities. Since AI takes information from all over the internet, it is important to think about the biases that can be found within the system. For this project, we start by differentiating the difference between inaccuracy and biases. Specifically, we discuss AI/ML bias through the lens of machine model training biases - both unintentional and unintentional biases - also called inherent biases, as well as data collection biases, and the impact of these biases in the real world.

Through research, we hope to create a comprehensive understanding of bias within the AI space and how best to mitigate it as a user.

The project intends to create awareness about AI bias and help our Ross peers navigate the complex but crucial ethical aspect of AI. At the same time, a significant portion of the guide is dedicated to 'responsible prompting', a practical guideline on crafting prompts mindfully and vigilantly spotting bias in AI responses. The goal of our project is to make AI interactions more fair, ethical, and responsible by empowering users to recognize and navigate AI biases.

In addition, the development of AI is also inseparable from Agile thinking. For example, we need to use Agile to continuously judge customer needs, just like the training mechanism of AI timely feedback. Agile methods emphasize rapid iteration during product development and gathering user feedback early on. This rapid iteration can make the team more acutely aware of potential ethical issues and make adjustments at an early stage. In the development and application of AI, especially in areas involving sensitive data or potential moral hazards, rapid iteration helps to detect and resolve possible ethical issues as early as possible. In a sense, AI and agility help each other. But the agile method itself does not ensure the ethics of AI, it is only a management and development method.
